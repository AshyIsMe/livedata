## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | sysinfo 0.38 API uses bool for refresh_processes | API differs from research, adapted to actual crate version |
| 01-01 | In-memory process data for Phase 1 | Follows plan; DuckDB storage deferred to later phase if needed |
| 01-01 | 5-second refresh interval | Balance between accuracy and system overhead |
